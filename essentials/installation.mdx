## Download the CFX Artifacts

1. Go to[ Windows Server Build](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) and download the Latest Recommended or Newest it doesn't really matter. (*I would recommend making sure to have* [*WinRAR* ](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)*for this*)

2. Open the file that you just downloaded that should be named something with **server.7z**

3. Optionally create a folder in your `C:\` drive

   1. Create folder `C:\SERVER_NAME`

   2. Create folder `C:\SERVER_NAME\Artifacts`

   3. Create folder `C:\SERVER_NAME\Server`

4. Extract from the server.7z everything into the `C:\SERVER_NAME\Artifacts` folder we created

## Starting your new RedM Server&#x20;

1. Find the file called `FXServer.exe` and double click it, this will launch the TXAdmin launcher for you to get started

2. In the Launch you should get your browser opened with TXAdmin asking you to link your account, link and proceed.&#x20;

3. After you completed this you should see a TXAdmin Launch setup page follow the instructions on page for Server Name etc.

4. Once you get to Deployment type you will choose **Remote URL Template**
